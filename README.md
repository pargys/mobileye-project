## Team Members:
* Batya Hochlerer
* Sara Faraji

## Phase 1: Traffic Lights Attention
Detect light sources in an image using a high light filter.
## Phase 2: Traffic Lights Detection
processing the data . Building and training CNN to detect traffic lights.
## Phase 3: Structure From Motion
Measure the distance from the traffic light using geometry of depth estimation.
## phase 4: Software Integration
Combine the above three algorithms into a single tool that tells us where traffic lights are in the world using only input images.

## Libraries/Technologies Used:
* python 3.7
* numpy
* matplotlib
* jupyterlab
* tensorflow
